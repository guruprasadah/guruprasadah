 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @guruprasadah
 
 I'm in 9th grade rn. If you've landed up here, go back. There's literally NOTHING in my profile. But if you still want to know more, here you go:
 * The timespan between my commits is a joke
 * I think I'm a codeing pro, but I'm really not.
 * I'm a linux fanboy
 * I take the worst possible decisions in an interactive progam.
