 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @guruprasadah
 
 I'm currently just escaping the Pizzaplex with Fred. I'll maybe come back here once I decommision them all.
 
 But then - you need to know about me:
 
 â—‰ I'm currently 14.\
 â—‰ I'm a wannabe coder that has the occasional spark of code. I start to work on something, and then most likely - I'll stop.\
 â—‰ Also, I'm a fan of Moon; not Sun - I mean come on!? Doesn't anybody think a split personality is cool!? Sun is a bot-ish croney, while Moon has the real chasing thriller-ness. 
 
 If you don't understand a lick of what I'm saying - google FNaF SB. You can get a briefing from that.
